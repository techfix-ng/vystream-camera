# StreamCaster — Android RTMP Streaming Application Specification

**Version:** 2.0 (Hardened)  
**Date:** March 14, 2026  
**Status:** Draft  
**Package ID:** `com.port80.app`  
**App Name:** StreamCaster

---

## 1. Overview

**StreamCaster** is a free, open-source native Android application that captures video and/or audio from the device camera and microphone and streams it in real-time to a user-configured RTMP/RTMPS ingestion endpoint.

Distributed via Google Play Store, F-Droid, and direct APK download.

### 1.1 Product Scope

- Native Android app to live-stream camera and/or microphone to a single RTMP/RTMPS ingestion endpoint.
- Optional concurrent local MP4 recording.
- Basic streaming HUD (bitrate, fps, resolution, duration, connection state).
- Multiple saved endpoint profiles with encrypted credential storage.
- Adaptive bitrate with device-capability-aware quality ladder.
- Background-capable via foreground service.

### 1.2 Non-Goals

The following are explicitly out of scope for the current version:

- Multi-destination streaming.
- Overlay rendering beyond a no-op architectural hook.
- H.265 encoding (deferred).
- SRT protocol (deferred).
- Stream scheduling.
- Analytics or tracking SDKs.
- Ads or in-app purchases.
- Unrelated Play Services runtime APIs in the `foss` build flavor. Bundled ML Kit barcode scanning and its required transitive support artifacts are an explicit exception for offline QR endpoint import.
- Tablet or Chromebook-optimized UI.

## 2. Technology Stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | **Kotlin** | Modern, concise, null-safe. RootEncoder is 65% Kotlin-native, ensuring seamless interop. |
| **Streaming Library** | **RootEncoder v2.7.x** (Apache 2.0) | Actively maintained (daily commits as of March 2026). Supports RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SRT. Provides Camera2 integration, adaptive bitrate, H.264/H.265/AAC encoding. |
| **Camera Framework** | **RootEncoder `RtmpCamera2`** (Camera2 internally), with CameraX only for QR endpoint import | RootEncoder's built-in camera class is the sole streaming/preview camera owner. The QR import scanner may use CameraX while RootEncoder is inactive. See §5.3. |
| **Build System** | **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)** with Android Gradle Plugin 8.x | Standard toolchain, compatible with VS Code + Gradle extension. |
| **Min SDK** | **API 23 (Android 6.0 Marshmallow)** | Required for EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android Keystore-backed), runtime permissions model, and modern MediaCodec behavior. Covers ~97% of active Android devices. |
| **Target SDK** | **API 35 (Android 15)** | Required for Google Play Store submission in 2026. |
| **Compile SDK** | **35** | Access to latest platform APIs. |
| **Architecture** | **MVVM** with Android ViewModel + StateFlow | Clean separation, lifecycle-aware, testable. |
| **DI** | **Hilt** | Standard Jetpack DI, minimal boilerplate. |
| **UI** | **Jetpack Compose** + Material 3 | Modern declarative UI; the camera preview surface uses an `AndroidView` wrapper around the RootEncoder preview. |
| **Persistence** | **DataStore (Preferences)** | For storing non-sensitive settings (default camera, resolution, etc.). |
| **Credential Storage** | **EncryptedSharedPreferences** (Keystore-backed) | For stream keys, passwords. Requires API ≥ 23. |
| **Background Service** | **Foreground Service** (type `camera` + `microphone`) | Required for background streaming. Displays a persistent notification. |
| **Crash Reporting** | **ACRA** (Apache 2.0) | Open-source, privacy-respecting, F-Droid compatible. Reports via email or self-hosted HTTP endpoint. No third-party cloud dependencies. |

### 2.1 Why RootEncoder over Alternatives

| Library | Min API | RTMPS | Active | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RootEncoder** | 16 (23 for Camera2 path) | Yes | Yes (March 2026) | **Selected** — widest compat, full feature set |
| Larix SDK | 24 | Yes | Yes | Rejected — higher min API, proprietary |
| libstreaming | 14 | No | No (EOL) | Rejected — dead project, no RTMP |
| HaishinKit Android | N/A | N/A | No | Rejected — no maintained Android port |

---

## 3. Supported Platforms and Operating Assumptions

| Dimension | Assumption |
|---|---|
| **Min SDK** | API 23 (Android 6.0). Required for EncryptedSharedPreferences, runtime permissions, and modern MediaCodec behavior. |
| **Target SDK** | API 35 (Android 15). Required for Google Play Store submission in 2026. |
| **Compile SDK** | 35. |
| **Device class** | Phones only. Tablets and Chromebooks are not guaranteed to work and are not tested against. |
| **Camera/encoder** | Hardware H.264 (Baseline/Main) + AAC-LC expected. H.265 is deferred. Devices without a hardware H.264 encoder are unsupported. |
| **Network** | Hostile networks assumed. RTMPS is the preferred transport. RTMP is permitted only with explicit user consent (see §9). |
| **OEM posture** | Aggressive battery/FGS restrictions (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, etc.) assumed active. Doze and app-standby are assumed active. The app must not rely on behavior that only works with battery optimizations disabled. |
| **App Standby Buckets** | API 28+ may classify infrequently used apps into the `RARE` bucket, restricting background network access. A user-initiated FGS start from the foreground exempts the app for that session. Connection retry logic must tolerate one initial network failure and retry on `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback.onAvailable()` rather than assuming network availability at FGS start. |

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Media Capture

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| MC-01 | Stream **video only**, **audio only**, or **both** — user selects before or during stream. Mid-session video→audio downgrade is permitted; audio→video upgrade requires camera reacquire and encoder re-init. | Must |
| MC-02 | Default to **back camera**. User can switch to front camera before or during stream. | Must |
| MC-03 | Live camera preview displayed before and during streaming. Preview must rebind after process death or activity recreation if the service is still alive. | Must |
| MC-04 | Orientation (portrait / landscape) selected by user before stream start; locked for the duration of the active session; unlocked only when idle. The lock must be applied in `Activity.onCreate()` before `setContentView()` using the persisted orientation preference — not as a post-stream-start action. When a stream is active, the lock is applied unconditionally on every `onCreate()` to prevent a re-orientation race during Activity recreation that would trigger a second configuration-change cycle and corrupt the Surface/preview state. | Must |
| MC-05 | **Local recording** — optional toggle to save a local MP4 copy simultaneously. On API 29+, the user selects a storage target via SAF or the app writes to MediaStore; enabling the toggle must immediately trigger an `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` SAF picker and persist the resulting URI via `takePersistableUriPermission()` — recording must not be activatable without a valid persisted storage grant. Local recording must tee encoded output buffers from the single hardware encoder into both the RTMP muxer and the MP4 muxer; no second encoder instance may be opened. On API 23–28, the app writes to app-specific external storage (`getExternalFilesDir`) with an export/share flow. If storage permission is denied or unavailable, recording must fail fast with a user prompt; streaming must not be blocked. | Must |

### 4.2 Video Settings

| ID | Requirement | Default | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| VS-01 | **Resolution** selectable from device-supported list, capped to codec-supported profiles/levels via `MediaCodecInfo`. | **720p (1280×720)** | Must |
| VS-02 | **Frame rate** selectable: 24, 25, 30, 60 fps — shown only if the device encoder advertises support. | **30 fps** | Must |
| VS-03 | **Video codec**: H.264 (Baseline/Main profile). H.265 deferred. | H.264 | Must |
| VS-04 | **Video bitrate** selectable or auto. Range: 500 kbps – 8 Mbps, capped to encoder capability. | **2.5 Mbps** (for 720p30) | Must |
| VS-05 | **Keyframe interval** configurable (1–5 seconds). | **2 seconds** | Should |

### 4.3 Audio Settings

| ID | Requirement | Default | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| AS-01 | **Audio codec**: AAC-LC. | AAC-LC | Must |
| AS-02 | **Sample rate**: 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz. | **44100 Hz** | Must |
| AS-03 | **Audio bitrate**: 64 / 96 / 128 / 192 kbps. | **128 kbps** | Must |
| AS-04 | **Channels**: Mono / Stereo. | **Stereo** | Should |
| AS-05 | **Mute toggle** during active stream (stops sending audio data). | — | Must |

### 4.4 RTMP Endpoint Configuration

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| EP-01 | User can enter an **RTMP URL** (e.g., `rtmp://ingest.example.com/live`). | Must |
| EP-02 | Support **RTMPS** (RTMP over TLS/SSL) endpoints. | Must |
| EP-03 | Optional **stream key** field (appended to URL or sent separately, per convention). | Must |
| EP-04 | Optional **username / password** authentication fields. | Must |
| EP-05 | **Save as default** — persists the last-used endpoint + key so the user doesn't re-enter it. Credentials stored only via EncryptedSharedPreferences. | Must |
| EP-06 | Multiple saved endpoint profiles (name + URL + key + auth). | Should |
| EP-07 | **Connection test** button — validates connectivity before going live. Must obey the same transport security rules as live streaming (see §9.2). | Should |

### 4.5 Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| AB-01 | Toggle to **enable/disable** adaptive bitrate. | Must |
| AB-02 | When enabled, dynamically lower video bitrate and/or resolution within a device-capability-aware ABR ladder on network congestion. | Must |
| AB-03 | Automatically recover bitrate when bandwidth improves. | Must |
| AB-04 | Display current effective bitrate on the streaming HUD. | Should |

### 4.6 Streaming Lifecycle

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| SL-01 | **Start / Stop** stream via prominent button. | Must |
| SL-02 | **Auto-reconnect** on network drop — configurable retry count (default: unlimited) and interval using exponential backoff with jitter (3 s, 6 s, 12 s, …, cap 60 s). Reconnect must operate within an already-running FGS; no new FGS starts from background. Reconnect attempts must be driven by `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback.onAvailable()` events in addition to the backoff timer; timer-based retries are suppressed while the device is in Doze to avoid burning backoff steps against Doze-blocked sockets — reconnect fires on `onAvailable()`, which already aligns with Doze maintenance windows. | Must |
| SL-03 | **Background streaming** — continues via foreground service when app is backgrounded or screen is off. The FGS may only be started from a user-initiated action (in-app button) while the activity is in the foreground (API 31+ FGS start restrictions). Notification actions cannot start a new FGS; see §7.1. | Must |
| SL-04 | **Notification controls** — start/stop/mute accessible from the persistent notification. A stop action must cancel any in-flight reconnect and leave the stream fully stopped. Actions must be debounced to prevent double-toggle races. | Must |
| SL-05 | Graceful shutdown on low battery (configurable threshold, default 5%). Auto-stop and finalize local recording at critical (≤ 2%). | Should |
| SL-06 | **Background camera revocation handling** — when the OS revokes camera access in the background, cleanly stop the video track, keep the audio-only RTMP session alive (or send a static placeholder frame if video-only mode). Show "Camera paused" in the notification. On return to foreground, re-acquire camera, re-init video encoder, and send an IDR frame to resume video. | Must |
| SL-07 | **Thermal throttling response** — on API 29+, register `PowerManager.OnThermalStatusChangedListener`. On `THERMAL_STATUS_MODERATE`: show HUD warning. On `THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE`: step down the ABR ladder (e.g., 720p→480p, 30→15 fps), performing a controlled encoder restart if resolution/fps change requires it. On `THERMAL_STATUS_CRITICAL`: stop stream and recording gracefully and show the user the reason. Enforce a minimum 60-second cooldown between thermal-triggered step changes to avoid rapid oscillation. Restore quality when thermals return to normal. On **API 23–28** (where `OnThermalStatusChangedListener` is unavailable), register a `BroadcastReceiver` for `Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` and monitor `BatteryManager.EXTRA_TEMPERATURE`; apply the same degradation progression when temperature exceeds 38°C (warn / bitrate reduction), with graceful stream stop at ≥ 43°C. | Must |
| SL-08 | **Audio focus / interruption handling** — on incoming call or audio focus loss, mute the microphone and show a muted indicator. Resume sending audio only on explicit user action (unmute). | Must |

### 4.7 Overlay Architecture (Future)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| OV-01 | Architecture supports an **overlay pipeline** (text, timestamps, watermarks) that can be rendered onto the video frame before encoding. | Must (arch) |
| OV-02 | Actual overlay rendering implementation. | Deferred |

> **Implementation note:** RootEncoder supports `GlStreamInterface` for custom OpenGL filters. The architecture will include a pluggable `OverlayManager` interface with a no-op default implementation. Future overlays will implement this interface and render via OpenGL shaders.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Target |
|---|---|---|
| NF-01 | **Startup to preview** in < 2 seconds on mid-range devices. | Must |
| NF-02 | **Streaming latency** (glass-to-glass) ≤ 3 seconds over stable LTE. Surface as a debug metric if exceeded. | Should |
| NF-03 | **Battery drain** ≤ 15% per hour of streaming at 720p30 on the reference device class (mid-range, 4000 mAh, API 28+). Low-end API 23 devices are not bound by this target; measured drain on low-end hardware must be documented in the test report. | Should |
| NF-04 | **Crash-free rate** ≥ 99.5%. | Must |
| NF-05 | **APK size** < 15 MB (before Play Store optimization). | Should |
| NF-06 | No third-party analytics or tracking SDKs. | Must |
| NF-07 | All sensitive data (stream keys, passwords) must be stored encrypted via Android Keystore-backed EncryptedSharedPreferences. The app must never fall back to plaintext storage. | Must |
| NF-08 | **No custom SSL bypass.** RTMPS connections must use the system default `TrustManager`. No `X509TrustManager` that accepts all certificates. Users with self-signed certs install them via Android system settings. | Must |
| NF-09 | **Thermal awareness.** On API 29+, register `OnThermalStatusChangedListener`. On API 23–28, fall back to `BatteryManager.EXTRA_TEMPERATURE` via `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` broadcasts. Progressively degrade stream quality to prevent device overheating and OS-forced frame drops. See SL-07. | Must |

### 6.2 Key Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `StreamViewModel` | Binds to `StreamingService`. Reads authoritative streaming state modelled as a `sealed class StreamState`: `Idle`, `Connecting`, `Live(cameraActive: Boolean)`, `Reconnecting`, `Stopping`, `Stopped(reason: StopReason)` where `StopReason` is `USER_REQUEST`, `ERROR_ENCODER`, `ERROR_AUTH`, `ERROR_CAMERA`, `THERMAL_CRITICAL`, or `BATTERY_CRITICAL`. Exposes preview surface, stream stats, and control actions. All start/stop/mute commands are idempotent. |
| `SettingsViewModel` | Reads/writes user preferences. Queries device for supported resolutions, frame rates, and codec profiles via `DeviceCapabilityQuery`. |
| `StreamingService` | Android Foreground Service (`camera` + `microphone` types). Owns the RootEncoder instance. Is the **single source of truth** for stream state. Manages lifecycle independently of the Activity so streaming survives backgrounding. Exposes state via `StateFlow` to bound clients. |
| `DeviceCapabilityQuery` | Queries `CameraManager` and `MediaCodecList` for available cameras, resolutions, frame rates, and codec profiles/levels. Used by settings UI only — does NOT own the camera or open it. |
| `AudioSourceManager` | Configures microphone via RootEncoder's `MicrophoneManager`. |
| `OverlayManager` | Interface with `fun onDrawFrame(canvas: GlCanvas)`. Default no-op. Future overlays plug in here. |
| `SettingsRepository` | Persists non-sensitive settings via Jetpack DataStore. |
| `EndpointProfileRepository` | CRUD for saved RTMP endpoint profiles. Credentials encrypted via EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by Android Keystore. |
| `ConnectionManager` | Handles RTMP connect/disconnect, auto-reconnect logic with exponential backoff + jitter, connection health monitoring. Cancels retries on explicit user stop. |

### 6.3 Camera Strategy — RootEncoder as Sole Camera Owner

> **Design decision:** RootEncoder provides optimized, battle-tested camera management classes (`RtmpCamera2`) that tightly couple camera capture with hardware encoding and RTMP muxing. Layering CameraX or a separate Camera2 session on top would risk surface contention, double camera ownership, and pipeline desynchronization.
>
> **Therefore, the app uses `RtmpCamera2` exclusively for streaming and preview camera ownership.**
> - CameraX is allowed only for the endpoint-import QR scanner, and only while no stream or RootEncoder preview owns the camera.
> - No Camera1 path (minSdk is 23; Camera2 is universally available).
> - `DeviceCapabilityQuery` only reads `CameraCharacteristics` and `MediaCodecInfo`; it never opens the camera.

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐

```

Camera switching and preview attachment are delegated directly to `RtmpCamera2.switchCamera()` and `RtmpCamera2.startPreview(surfaceView)`.

## 7. Lifecycle and State Management

### 7.1 Foreground Service Rules

- The foreground service must declare `android:foregroundServiceType="camera|microphone"` in the manifest `<service>` element. This attribute is required from **API 30** to legally access the camera or microphone from an FGS. Additionally, `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA" />` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` are required as explicit permissions from **API 34**.
- The FGS may only be started from a **user-initiated action**: the in-app Start button while the Activity is in the foreground. This satisfies API 31+ FGS start restrictions.
- **Notification actions cannot start a new FGS.** On API 34+, calling `startForegroundService()` with camera/microphone types from a `BroadcastReceiver` `PendingIntent` while the app is not in the foreground throws `BackgroundServiceStartNotAllowedException`. The notification "Start" action must deep-link to the Activity via an explicit `Intent`; it must never call `startForegroundService()` directly. Notification Stop and Mute/Unmute remain valid controls on an **already-running** FGS.
- Auto-reconnect operates within an already-running FGS. The app must never attempt to start a new FGS from the background without a user affordance.
- If the OS kills the FGS, the app must not silently restart it. On next activity launch, display a notification or in-app message indicating the session ended and require the user to start a new session.

### 7.2 Activity ↔ Service Binding

- `StreamViewModel` binds to `StreamingService` via `ServiceConnection`.
- The service exposes authoritative state via `StateFlow<StreamState>`. The UI layer is a read-only observer of this state.
- On activity recreation (config change, process death with surviving service), the ViewModel must rebind, restore the preview surface to the existing RootEncoder instance, and reflect current stats.
- If the service has been killed by the time the activity restarts, the ViewModel must show `Stopped(USER_REQUEST)` state and clear any stale reconnect state.
- The ViewModel must hold the preview surface reference as a `WeakReference<SurfaceHolder>` or use a `SurfaceRequest`-style signal. The Activity/Composable sets this reference on `surfaceCreated()` and clears it on `surfaceDestroyed()`. The ViewModel must never retain a strong reference to a `View` or `Surface` across Activity lifecycle boundaries.

### 7.3 Process Death Recovery

- If the service is alive and the activity process is recreated, the preview surface must be re-attached to RootEncoder's existing camera session.
- When rebinding after process death, `RtmpCamera2.startPreview()` must not be called until `SurfaceHolder.Callback.surfaceCreated()` has fired on the new `SurfaceView`. The ViewModel must gate the preview attach using a `CompletableDeferred<SurfaceHolder>` or equivalent surface-ready signal resolved by the `AndroidView` composable. Calling `startPreview()` before the Surface is attached causes the camera HAL to throw `IllegalArgumentException: invalid surface`.
- If both activity and service are dead, the app starts in the default idle state. No automatic stream resumption occurs.

### 7.4 Notification Behavior

- The persistent FGS notification shows current state: Live, Reconnecting, Paused (camera revoked), or Stopped.
- Notification actions: Start, Stop, Mute/Unmute.
- A Stop action must immediately cancel any pending reconnect attempts and transition to stopped state. No zombie notifications may persist after the service stops.
- Actions must be debounced (≥ 500 ms) to prevent double-toggle races between notification and in-app UI.

---

## 8. Media Pipeline Requirements

### 8.1 Encoder Initialization

- Before starting a stream, validate the chosen resolution, frame rate, and profile against `MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities` and `VideoCapabilities`. If the device cannot support the requested configuration, fail fast with an actionable error message and suggest a supported configuration.
- Pre-flight: attempt `MediaCodec.configure()` with the chosen parameters before connecting to the RTMP endpoint to catch encoder failures early.
- During streaming, monitor the actual encoded output frame rate (frames delivered from the `MediaCodec` output buffer) against the configured input fps. If measured output fps falls below 80% of configured fps for more than 5 consecutive seconds, treat this as a backpressure event and trigger the ABR step-down path. This detects hardware-level encoder throttling that `MediaCodecInfo.VideoCapabilities.isSizeAndRateSupported()` cannot predict under sustained thermal load (particularly on MediaTek/Unisoc SoCs).

### 8.2 ABR Ladder

- Define a per-device quality ladder based on encoder capabilities, e.g.:
  - **1080p30 → 720p30 → 540p30 → 480p30** (resolution steps)
  - **30 fps → 24 fps → 15 fps** (frame rate steps)
  - Bitrate scales proportionally to resolution × fps.
- ABR first reduces bitrate only. If insufficient, step down resolution/fps via controlled encoder restart.
- Prefer bitrate reduction before frame skipping. If encoder backpressure is detected, drop non-keyframes first.
- All quality-change requests from **both** the ABR system and the thermal throttling system (SL-07) must be serialized through a single `EncoderController` component using a coroutine `Mutex` or `Channel`. This prevents concurrent `MediaCodec.release()` / `configure()` / `start()` sequences from racing and throwing `IllegalStateException` when both systems fire within the same window (e.g., network degrades while device heats).
- The 60-second thermal cooldown (SL-07) applies only to **thermal-triggered** resolution/fps changes that require an encoder restart. ABR **bitrate-only** reductions and recoveries do not require an encoder restart and bypass the cooldown entirely. ABR resolution/fps changes that do require an encoder restart are subject to the cooldown timer.

### 8.3 Encoder Restart for Quality Changes

- Resolution or frame rate changes during a live stream require a controlled re-init sequence:
  1. Stop the preview and video track.
  2. Release the encoder.
  3. Reconfigure with the new profile.
  4. Restart the encoder and preview.
  5. Send an IDR frame immediately.
- Target: stream gap ≤ 3 seconds during a quality change.

### 8.4 Frame Drop Policy

- Expose a `droppedFrameCount` metric (see §14).
- Prefer bitrate reduction over frame dropping.
- If backpressure forces drops, drop B/P-frames before keyframes.

### 8.5 Latency

- Target glass-to-glass ≤ 3 seconds on stable LTE.
- Surface current measured latency as a debug metric if it exceeds target.

## 9. Security and Privacy Requirements

### 9.1 Credential Storage

- Stream keys and passwords must be stored using EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by Android Keystore.
- The app must never fall back to plaintext storage under any circumstance.
- MinSdk 23 guarantees Keystore availability. No API < 23 fallback path exists or is needed.
- The FGS must never receive stream keys or RTMP URLs with embedded credentials via `Intent` extras. The FGS start `Intent` carries only a non-sensitive profile ID (`String` or `Long`); the service retrieves credentials directly from `EndpointProfileRepository` at runtime. This prevents key exfiltration via `adb shell dumpsys activity service` or crash-report Intent capture.
- The manifest must declare `android:allowBackup="false"` in the `<application>` element, or configure a `BackupAgent` with rules that exclude the EncryptedSharedPreferences files from cloud and device-to-device backup. When the app is installed on a new device after a restore and the Keystore key is absent, it must display an explicit prompt informing the user that credentials must be re-entered.

### 9.2 Transport Security

- If a profile includes authentication (username/password) or a stream key, the app must enforce RTMPS.
- If the user has configured auth and enters an `rtmp://` URL, the app must display a warning dialog explaining the risk of sending credentials over plaintext and require explicit per-attempt opt-in before proceeding.
- The connection test button must obey the same transport rules: it must not send credentials over plaintext RTMP without explicit user consent.
- RTMPS must use the system default `TrustManager`. No custom `X509TrustManager` that accepts all certificates. Users needing self-signed certs must install them into the Android system trust store.

### 9.3 Logging and Crash Reports

- The app must never log RTMP URLs containing stream keys, auth headers, passwords, or tokens in any log level.
- All sensitive fields must be masked in logs and metrics (e.g., `rtmp://host/app/****`).
- ACRA crash reports must:
  - Exclude or redact RTMP URLs, stream keys, and auth fields from all `ReportField` entries.
  - Fully exclude `ReportField.SHARED_PREFERENCES` and `ReportField.LOGCAT` from all report configurations.
  - Disable automatic logcat attachment **unconditionally in release builds**. RootEncoder logs full RTMP URLs (including stream key path segments) at `Log.d`/`Log.i` level internally; these cannot be safely scrubbed after they enter Logcat.
  - Apply a URL-sanitization transformation to all remaining string-valued fields before any field is serialized: replace key path segments using the pattern `rtmp[s]?://([^/\s]+/[^/\s]+)/\S+` → `rtmp[s]://<host>/<app>/****`.
  - Include a unit test verifying that a synthetic crash report containing a known stream key string produces zero occurrences of that string after the sanitization pass.
  - Send reports only to user-configured endpoints. ACRA HTTP transport must enforce **HTTPS**. If the user configures a plain `http://` endpoint, the app must display a warning and require explicit opt-in. Plaintext crash report transmission must never occur silently.

### 9.4 Permissions

| Permission | When Requested | Required For |
|---|---|---|
| `CAMERA` | Stream start (video modes) | Video capture |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Stream start (audio modes) | Audio capture |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Manifest (auto-granted) | Background streaming |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA` | Manifest (API 34+) | FGS type permission (`<uses-permission>`). Distinct from `android:foregroundServiceType` attribute, which is required from API 30. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` | Manifest (API 34+) | FGS type permission (`<uses-permission>`). Distinct from `android:foregroundServiceType` attribute, which is required from API 30. |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Runtime (API 33+) | FGS notification display |
| `INTERNET` | Manifest (auto-granted) | RTMP connection |
| `WAKE_LOCK` | Manifest (auto-granted) | Keep CPU alive during background stream |

> **Removed:** `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is not needed with minSdk 23. Local recording uses app-specific external storage (API 23–28) or MediaStore/SAF (API 29+).

### 9.5 Permissions Flow

```
App Launch
  │
  ├─ API ≥ 33? → Request POST_NOTIFICATIONS
  │
  └─ User taps "Start Stream"
       │
       ├─ Video enabled? → Check CAMERA permission
       │     └─ Denied? → Show rationale → Re-request or disable video
       │
       ├─ Audio enabled? → Check RECORD_AUDIO permission
       │     └─ Denied? → Show rationale → Re-request or disable audio
       │
       └─ All required permissions granted → Start StreamingService → Connect RTMP
```

### 9.6 Background Capture

- The camera and microphone must only be accessed while the foreground service is active with the corresponding type declarations.
- Camera/mic use indicators are shown per OS defaults (API 31+ privacy indicators).
- No audio or video capture may occur without an active FGS.

## 10. Screen Map & UI

### 10.1 Screens

| Screen | Description |
|---|---|
| **Main / Stream** | Camera preview (full-screen), start/stop button, mute button, camera-switch button, stream status badge, recording indicator. Minimal HUD overlay showing: bitrate, FPS, duration, connection status. |
| **Endpoint Setup** | RTMP(S) URL field, stream key field, optional username/password, "Test Connection" button, "Save as Default" toggle, saved profiles list. |
| **Video/Audio Settings** | Resolution picker (filtered by device), frame rate picker, video bitrate slider, audio bitrate picker, mono/stereo toggle, ABR enable/disable, keyframe interval, local recording toggle. |
| **General Settings** | Default camera (front/back), orientation mode (landscape default, explicit portrait toggle), auto-reconnect toggle + retry settings, battery threshold, media stream selection (video+audio / video-only / audio-only). |

### 10.2 Navigation

```
Main (Stream) ──┬── Endpoint Setup
                ├── Video/Audio Settings
                └── General Settings
```

Single-activity architecture with Compose Navigation.

### 10.3 Stream Screen HUD Layout
Since landscape is the primary UX (see §19 Decision 9), the landscape layout is the normative reference. Portrait is a secondary option explicitly toggled by the user.

#### Landscape (Default)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● LIVE  00:12:34   ⇕ 2.4 Mbps  30fps  720p   🔴 REC │  ← status bar
│                                          ┌────────┐ │
│                                          │[🔇 Mute]│ │
│         [Camera Preview]                │[⏺ START]│ │
│     (fills width, 16:9 aspect ratio)    │[🔄 Cam ]│ │
│                                          └────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Controls are at the right edge in landscape to remain within thumb reach. All UI elements must respect `WindowInsets.displayCutout` and `WindowInsets.navigationBars` to avoid occlusion by system UI or camera cutouts.

#### Portrait (User-Toggled)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● LIVE  00:12:34        🔴 REC      │  ← status bar
│                                      │

## 11. Reliability and Failure Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Network drop** | Pause send. Reconnect with exponential backoff + jitter (3 s, 6 s, 12 s, …, cap 60 s). In Doze, retries must not exceed one per minute unless the user has exempted the app from battery optimizations. Show "Reconnecting…" badge. Resume on success. |
| **RTMP auth failure** | Stop stream, show error with option to edit credentials. |
| **Encoder error** | Attempt one re-init. If it fails, stop stream and show explicit error identifying the failure cause. |
| **Camera unavailable** | Try alternate camera. If none available, offer audio-only mode. |
| **Camera revoked (background)** | Cleanly stop video track. Keep audio-only RTMP session alive (or send static placeholder frame if video-only). Show "Camera paused" in notification. On return to foreground: re-acquire camera, re-init video encoder, send IDR to resume video. |
| **Microphone revoked mid-stream** | Stop stream entirely and surface an error. Audio track loss cannot be gracefully degraded. |
| **Thermal throttle** | On `THERMAL_STATUS_MODERATE`: warn user via HUD badge. On `THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE`: step down ABR ladder with controlled encoder restart if needed (minimum 60 s between steps). On `THERMAL_STATUS_CRITICAL`: stop stream and recording gracefully, display reason to user. |
| **FGS killed by OS** | Do not silently restart. On next activity launch, display notification/toast indicating session ended. Require user to start a new session. |
| **Low battery** | Below configured threshold: show warning. Below critical (≤ 2%): auto-stop stream and finalize local recording. |
| **Prolonged session** | On low-end devices (`ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice() == true` or available RAM < 2 GB at stream start), app monitors session duration. After a configurable default of 90 minutes (adjustable in General Settings), show a notification recommending stopping to prevent heat/battery risk. Suppressed if `BatteryManager.isCharging()` is `true` at recommendation time. |
| **Insufficient storage** | Stop recording, continue streaming, notify user. |
| **Audio focus loss / incoming call** | Mute microphone and show muted indicator. Resume sending audio only on explicit user action (unmute button). |

---

## 12. Observability and Diagnostics

### 12.1 Metrics (non-PII)

The following metrics must be tracked internally for HUD display and debug diagnostics. They must not contain PII or credentials.

- Current and target bitrate (video/audio).
- Current fps and dropped frame count.
- Encoder init success/failure count.
- Reconnect attempt count and success/failure ratio.
- Thermal level transitions.
- Storage write errors.
- FGS start success/failure events.
- Permission denial events.

### 12.2 HUD

The streaming HUD must display: live bitrate, fps, resolution, session duration, connection state (live/reconnecting/stopped), recording state (on/off), and a thermal warning badge when quality has been degraded.

### 12.3 Debug Logging

- Structured logging via Logcat only in debug builds.
- All secrets must be redacted in every log level (debug and release).
- Production logs must be minimal and rate-limited.

### 12.4 Health Checks

- The connection test endpoint should use a lightweight probe (e.g., RTMP handshake only, or HEAD/OPTIONS where applicable).
- Timeouts for connection test must be capped (default: 10 seconds).
- Test result must be surfaced to the user with actionable messaging (success, timeout, auth failure, TLS error).

```

> **Removed:** CameraX dependencies (`camerax-core`, `camerax-camera2`, `camerax-lifecycle`). Camera is managed exclusively by RootEncoder's `RtmpCamera2`. See §6.3.

---

## 15. Testing Strategy

| Layer | Approach |
|---|---|
| **ViewModel** | JUnit 5 + Turbine (StateFlow testing). Mock repositories and service binding. |
| **Repository** | JUnit 5 + Robolectric for DataStore and EncryptedSharedPreferences tests. |
| **ConnectionManager** | Unit test reconnection logic, backoff timing, jitter, Doze-aware retry capping. |
| **DeviceCapabilityQuery** | Instrumented tests on real devices (API 23 + latest). |
| **Streaming E2E** | Manual test matrix: 3 devices (low-end API 23, mid-range API 28, flagship API 35) × (RTMP, RTMPS) × (video+audio, video-only, audio-only). |
| **Lifecycle** | Instrumented tests for process death with active service, activity recreation, preview rebind, FGS start restrictions. |
| **UI** | Compose UI tests for navigation, control states, and notification action handling. |

---

## 16. Release & Signing

- **Debug builds:** Auto-signed with debug keystore.
- **Release builds:** Signed with a release keystore stored outside the repo. Keystore path and passwords provided via `local.properties` or CI environment variables.
- **ProGuard / R8:** Enabled for release builds. RootEncoder ProGuard rules included.
- **App Bundle:** `.aab` format for Play Store. `.apk` for sideloading.

### 16.1 Build Flavors (F-Droid Compatibility)

To guarantee F-Droid acceptance, the project uses Gradle product flavors:

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
android {
    flavorDimensions += "distribution"
    productFlavors {
        create("foss") {
            dimension = "distribution"
            // Excludes ALL proprietary / GMS dependencies
        }
        create("gms") {
            dimension = "distribution"
            // May include Google Play Services in the future if needed
        }
    }
}
```

| Flavor | Play Store | F-Droid | Direct APK | GMS allowed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gms` | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| `foss` | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Bundled ML Kit barcode scanning subtree allowlisted; no unrelated Play Services APIs** |

**Rule:** Bundled `com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning` and the `com.google.android.gms:*` artifacts it brings transitively are intentionally allowed for offline QR endpoint import in `foss`. Firebase and unrelated Play Services APIs remain forbidden. CI must verify this via `./gradlew :app:dependencies --configuration fossReleaseRuntimeClasspath | grep -i "gms\|play-services\|mlkit"`; all matches must belong to the ML Kit barcode-scanning dependency subtree.

**F-Droid APK size:** To keep per-download size within the 15 MB target (NF-05), configure Gradle ABI splits for the `foss` release variant. A universal APK including all four RootEncoder native ABI variants would exceed 15 MB.

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
splits {
    abi {
        isEnable = true
        reset()
        include("arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a")
        isUniversalApk = false
    }
}
```

F-Droid supports multi-APK submissions. The 15 MB target applies per-ABI APK, not the universal binary.

## 18. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| RootEncoder API breaking changes | Build failure | Pin to specific version; monitor releases. |
| RootEncoder Camera2 quirks on low-end / OEM devices | Black preview, crashes | Use `DeviceCapabilityQuery` to validate before selecting resolution/fps. Test on diversified device set. File upstream issues. |
| RTMPS certificate validation failures | Cannot connect to some endpoints | Strictly enforce standard CA validation. No custom `X509TrustManager`. Users needing self-signed certs must install them into the Android system trust store. Document this in a help screen. |
| Background streaming killed by OEM battery optimization | Stream drops | Guide user to disable battery optimization for the app; use `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` where appropriate. Show a one-time setup guide for Samsung/Xiaomi/Huawei. |
| Large APK size from RootEncoder native libs | User drop-off | Use App Bundle; split by ABI. Target < 15 MB. |
| Thermal throttling causes frame drops / encoder crash | Stuttering stream, ANR | Monitor thermals via `OnThermalStatusChangedListener` (API 29+). Progressive degradation with 60 s cooldown. See SL-07. |
| OEM battery optimization kills foreground service | Silent stream death | Do not silently restart. Notify user on next launch. Use `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`; display OEM-specific guidance. |
| FGS start restrictions (API 31+) | Cannot start streaming from background | FGS starts only from user-initiated actions while activity is foregrounded or via notification action. Auto-reconnect operates within an already-running FGS only. |
| Encoder does not support requested config | Crash or silent failure on stream start | Pre-flight validate against `MediaCodecInfo` before connecting. Fail fast with actionable suggestion. |
| F-Droid build rejected due to forbidden Play Services dependencies | Cannot distribute on F-Droid | Use Gradle product flavors (`foss` / `gms`). CI allows the bundled ML Kit barcode-scanning subtree for QR import but rejects unrelated Play Services APIs in `foss`. See §16.1. |
| Concurrent ABR + thermal encoder restart | FGS crash from `MediaCodec.IllegalStateException` when both systems trigger an encoder re-init simultaneously | All quality-change requests serialized through `EncoderController` with a coroutine `Mutex`. See §8.2. |
| Stream key exfiltration via Intent extra | Credentials visible via `adb shell dumpsys activity service` or captured in ACRA crash report Intent bundle | FGS start `Intent` carries only a profile ID; credentials fetched internally from `EndpointProfileRepository`. See §9.1. |
| EncryptedSharedPreferences restore failure | On a new device after backup restore, Keystore key is absent; app throws `SecurityException` and all credentials are silently lost | Declare `android:allowBackup="false"` or configure `BackupAgent` exclusion rules; prompt user to re-enter credentials. See §9.1. |

---

## 19. Resolved Decisions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | App name & package ID | **StreamCaster** / `com.port80.app` |
| 2 | Icon / branding | Minimal geometric: camera lens + broadcast signal arcs. Primary: #E53935 (red), Accent: #1E88E5 (blue), Dark surface: #121212. |
| 3 | Distribution | **All:** Google Play Store (`.aab`), F-Droid, direct APK (`.apk` via GitHub Releases). |
| 4 | Monetization | **Free.** No ads, no in-app purchases. |
| 5 | Crash reporting | **ACRA** (open-source, Apache 2.0). Reports via HTTP to self-hosted endpoint or email. F-Droid compatible, zero third-party tracking. Credential redaction required. |
| 6 | minSdk | **API 23** (raised from 21). Required for EncryptedSharedPreferences, reliable Keystore, and runtime permissions. Drops ~1% of active devices with no viable workaround. |
| 7 | Camera framework | **RootEncoder `RtmpCamera2` exclusively.** CameraX removed to avoid surface contention. Camera1 path removed (unnecessary with minSdk 23). |
| 8 | Transport security default | **RTMPS enforced when auth/keys are present.** RTMP with credentials requires explicit per-attempt user opt-in. |
| 9 | Orientation support | **Landscape first.** UX relies on landscape as primary, providing an option for portrait that the user must explicitly toggle. |
| 10 | Session duration limit | **Recommendation-based.** On low-end devices, app monitors session duration and issues a notification recommending stopping to prevent heat/battery drain, unless connected to power. |

---

## 20. Acceptance Criteria

The following criteria are testable conditions that must pass before the corresponding feature is considered complete.

| # | Criterion |
|---|---|
| AC-01 | FGS start succeeds only via user action (in-app button or notification action). Attempting background auto-start without user affordance is blocked and surfaced to the user. |
| AC-02 | Auto-reconnect honors Doze: retries do not exceed one attempt per minute while the device is in idle mode, unless the user has exempted the app from battery optimizations. |
| AC-03 | Switching from 720p30 to 480p15 on `THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE` restarts the encoder without crash. Stream resumes within 3 seconds. |
| AC-04 | Credentials are stored encrypted on API ≥ 23 via EncryptedSharedPreferences. No plaintext fallback exists. |
| AC-05 | Notification stop action cancels in-flight reconnect and leaves stream stopped. No zombie notifications remain after the service stops. |
| AC-06 | Connection test with auth over `rtmp://` prompts a plaintext warning dialog. Credentials are transmitted only after explicit user confirmation. |
| AC-07 | ACRA crash reports do not contain stream keys, passwords, or auth headers in any `ReportField`. |
| AC-08 | After process death with the service still running, relaunching the activity rebinds to the service, restores preview, and reflects live stats within 2 seconds. |
| AC-09 | If the OS kills the FGS, the next activity launch shows a session-ended message. No silent restart occurs. |
| AC-10 | Local recording on API 29+ uses MediaStore or SAF. If the user has not granted storage access, recording fails fast with a user prompt; streaming is not blocked. |
| AC-11 | On incoming phone call, the app mutes the microphone and displays a muted indicator. Audio resumes only on explicit user unmute. |
| AC-12 | Camera revocation in background switches to audio-only. Returning to foreground re-acquires camera and resumes video with an IDR frame. |
| AC-13 | The FGS start `Intent` contains only a non-sensitive profile ID. No stream key or auth credential appears as an Intent extra at any log level or in `adb shell dumpsys activity service`. |
| AC-14 | The manifest declares `android:allowBackup="false"` or a `BackupAgent` that excludes EncryptedSharedPreferences. A simulated restore-then-launch scenario displays a credentials re-entry prompt rather than crashing. |
| AC-15 | ACRA release-build crash report for an active stream contains zero occurrences of a synthetic stream key string across all `ReportField` entries, including `LOGCAT` and `SHARED_PREFERENCES`. |
| AC-16 | Simultaneous ABR step-down and `THERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE` event do not crash the encoder or FGS. `EncoderController` serializes both requests and stream resumes within 3 seconds. |
| AC-17 | On API 28, a mocked `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` broadcast with `EXTRA_TEMPERATURE` > 38°C triggers a HUD thermal warning. Temperature ≥ 43°C triggers graceful stream stop with reason displayed. |
| AC-18 | Enabling local recording for the first time on API 29+ immediately presents the SAF folder picker. Tapping Start without completing the SAF grant leaves recording blocked and streaming unaffected. |
| AC-19 | In landscape orientation with an active stream, a device rotation gesture does not restart the stream, alter `StreamState`, or cause a visible flash of portrait orientation. |
